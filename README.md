A collection of C++ libraries I personally maintained and used in solving competitive programming problems.
Some I frequenly used or having high quality are listed below:

Math/ModInt.h: A ModInt type to deal with intergers having to mod some number(e.g 1e9+7)

Graph/max flow.h: A Dinic's implementation for computing max flow

Search/GetID.h: A library to assign strings or objects of other types a unique id

Search/UnionFind.h: A implemenation of union find disjoint set

Search/Segment tree(Iterative).h: A general purpose segment tree template with lazy propagation(support non-commutative updates)

Search/Treap.h: A Treap implementation that is configurable with toggles on lazy propagation, supporting size and sum.
